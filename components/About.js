            A microbiologist who changed track to become a web developer by
            dedicating <span>3+ years</span> of my career to web development and
            Search Engine Optimization (SEO), building and deploying responsive
            and bug-free frontend website, I feel incredibly connected to web
            develoment goal of transforming the programming technology industry

              As a self-taught frontend web junkie, when I visit a website or
              click and surf into web apps, I immediately start analyzing
              everything from the User Experience(UX) and the user Interface
              (UI), to the source code, operations and functionality - and
              that's just in my spare time!

              Being a Nigerian, I have grown up with curiousity for programming
              in general, web development, and the use of codes as a form of
              self-expression. So much in demand in our present day, I believe
              the quest for websites is an essential part of the modern humans
              in this generation.
